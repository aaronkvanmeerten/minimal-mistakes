We hope you have time to enjoy the city we love so much while you’re here! We’ve compiled a list of favorite ways to experience Austin:

Food
====

Austin food is an amazing collection of restaurants.  These are some of our favorites.

**Chez Nous** - 
[http://cheznousaustin.com](http://cheznousaustin.com/)

The casual, intimate atmosphere paired with delicious regional French cuisine make this one of our absolute favorite spots. Seating is limited so it’s best to come early!


**Chuy’s** -

Legendary Tex-Mex that started right here in Austin. We recommend the original Chuy’s location on Barton Springs (which is less than a 10-minute walk from our wedding venue).

**Eastside Cafe** -

Their delicious comfort food has earned national acclaim, and the converted bungalow & attached garden (where they grow the vegetables you’ll eat!) lend to a charming atmosphere.

**East Side King** - 
[http://eskaustin.com](http://eskaustin.com/)

Modern southeast Asian with a big twist, this hip series of restaurants is owned by Paul Qui, who won Top Chef Texas in 2012. The beet home fries are not to be missed.

**Barbecue** -

Austin’s barbecue scene has been thriving in recent years, and who does it best is a hotly debated topic. There are many options to choose from, and The Austin Chronicle has put together [a handy top 10 list here](http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/2014-01-03/top-10-austin-barbecue-joints/)

Shopping
========
Shops and farmers markets are all over Austin.

**South Congress Avenue** - 
[http://www.austintexas.org/listings/south-congress-ave-soco-/4359/](http://www.austintexas.org/listings/south-congress-ave-soco-/4359/)

Featuring an eclectic mix of boutiques, vintage clothing stores, galleries, gourmet restaurants, and the unrivaled Allens Boots, South Congress is a must-see part of the Austin experience.

**Premium Outlets and Tanger Outlets in San Marcos** - 
[http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlets/outlet.asp?id=88](http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlets/outlet.asp?id=88) [http://www.tangeroutlet.com/sanmarcos/](http://www.tangeroutlet.com/sanmarcos/)

Located in San Marcos, 30 minutes south of Austin on I-35, these two outlets combined have over 350 stores and attract visitors from all over Texas and beyond.

**SFC Farmer’s Markets** - 
[http://sustainablefoodcenter.org/programs/sfc-farmers-market/sfc-farmers-market-downtown](http://sustainablefoodcenter.org/programs/sfc-farmers-market/sfc-farmers-market-downtown)

Saturday mornings equal farmer’s markets in Austin. Local produce, dairy and meats may be the main draw, but you will also find fresh breakfast options, small batch jams and sauces, and other wares like soaps, lotions and jewelry here. We recommend the downtown location in Republic Square Park.

Fun Attractions
===============
Austin has a fun and weird side.  Check out these attractions.

**Peter Pan Mini Golf** - 
[http://peterpanminigolf.com/](http://peterpanminigolf.com/)

An Austin tradition since 1946, come see Peter Pan, the Rabbit, the Piggy Bank and all their friends. There are two separate 18-hole courses, great for family fun.

**Alamo Drafthouse Cinema** [http://drafthouse.com/austin/south_lamar](http://drafthouse.com/austin/south_lamar)

No trip here is complete without taking in food and a movie at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema. It’s an experience you won’t soon forget.

**Texas State Capitol** - 
[http://www.tspb.state.tx.us/SPB/Plan/Plan.htm](http://www.tspb.state.tx.us/SPB/Plan/Plan.htm)

The Capitol is a great place to take in history and gorgeous architecture, and admission is always free!

Outdoor Activities
==================
Austin in May is a perfect time to explore our many parks and pools.

**Zilker Park** -

Our wedding venue, the Umlauf Sculpture Garden, is just one of the many attractions in Zilker Park. The Botanical Gardens will be beautiful in May, and the Zilker Zephyr miniature train is always fun for kids.

**Mt. Bonnell** - 
[http://www.austinparks.org/our-parks.html?parkid=287](http://www.austinparks.org/our-parks.html?parkid=287)

If you can manage the hike up a long, long staircase, this peak offers the best view in all of Austin.

**Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center** - 
[https://www.wildflower.org/visit.php](https://www.wildflower.org/visit.php)

The Wildflower Center is a beautiful way to see and learn about the native plants and landscapes of Central Texas. It also features hiking and running trails, rotating art exhibits and fun activities for kids.
